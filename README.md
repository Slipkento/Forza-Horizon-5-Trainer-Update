## 📘 Project Overview  
The Forza Horizon Research Suite is an academic toolkit designed for studying vehicle physics and driving mechanics in racing simulations. This environment enables:  

- Real-time telemetry data capture  
- Vehicle performance benchmarking  
- Driving technique analysis  
- Engine and suspension behavior research  

```python  
# Vehicle telemetry capture example  
def capture_vehicle_metrics():  
    forza = ForzaResearchClient()  
    telemetry = forza.capture_telemetry(  
        metrics=["speed", "rpm", "g-force", "suspension_load"]  
    )  
    return telemetry.generate_performance_report()  
```
